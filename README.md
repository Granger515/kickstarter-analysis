#Kickstarter Fundraiser Analysis

##Project Overview

The purpose of the project was to practice Excel skills demonstrated in class and the activities on Canvas in a ‘real-world’ style project. The project was scenario was that a friend was considering funding a play through a Kickstarter. The analyst offered to review data to find characteristics of successful and failed Kickstarter campaigns in the past, with a specific emphasis on Kickstarter campaigns that resembled the friend’s planned project. The planned project as a play.

##Analyses and Challenges

Data was sorted. It was reviewed visually. Data such as dates was transformed to be more useful for analyses. Pivot charts were created to explore possible determinants of campaign success. Relevant visualizations were created. Challenges included the limitations of Excel to handle larger data sets without delays and the vagueness of some instructions in analyzing the data. For example, and basically unstated in the instructions, it was unclear that the Github readme file was to be used to document processes as the instructions to do so were at the very end of this process. This makes it all but impossible for anyone without a very good memory to create notes regarding their process beyond just summarizing the assignment and activities. Screenshots of this process are not provided as this requirement was not known in advance and the analyses were completed without taking screenshots.

##Areas Explored!

A few areas were explored in the analyses. It was discovered that overall theatrical kick starters were more likely than not to be successful. Plays, a subcategory of theatre, also maintained high levels of success in Kickstarter campaigns. The launch date of a Kickstarter campaign for plays was explored relative to the month it was started.

#$Outcomes by Launch Date

The Theater Outcomes by Launch Date chart suggests that (1) late spring to summer is a popular time to start a Kickstarter for plays and that (2) the month of the start of the Kickstarter does not seem to impact success rates, with the possible exceptions of October and December predicting a greater likelihood of failure. While successes do outpace failures the trend lines follow similar slopes and success to failure ratios are approximately between 2 to 1 and 5 to 3 the majority of the year. These shrank to 5 to 4 in October and 1 to 1 in December.

##Outcomes by Fundraising Goals

Outcomes were influenced by fundraising goals. Lower goals generally were more successful. Success rates dropped dramatically once a goal of $15,000 or greater was set. This did reverse briefly between $35,000 and $45,000. However, this was likely an anomaly as only nine Kickstarter campaigns for plays were conducted with goals in this range.

##Conclusions

Overall, the data set was sparse regarding fundraising for plays at higher fundraising goals. A dataset with a greater sample of Kickstarter campaigns at higher levels would be useful in determining the value, or lack of value, of larger campaigns in this area. It would also be worth exploring the average donation size broken down by fundraiser goal. It may be that a few larger donations are driving the success of different sizes of campaigns. On could easily envision smaller campaigns allowing a sense of ownership which drives more smaller donations, a few larger donations completely funding smaller campaigns, or even larger campaign success rates being driven exclusively by the ability to attract large donations.
